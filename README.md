Project Overview :
This project focuses on analyzing and predicting road accident severity using advanced data techniques. The dataset was processed through data cleaning and mining with Python and SQL, ensuring accuracy and consistency for analysis.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) was conducted to uncover patterns and relationships among variables. Key insights were visualized using pie charts and bar plots, providing a clear understanding of the data.
Advanced analysis was performed using Power BI, and machine learning algorithms like Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting were applied. Gradient Boosting emerged as the best-performing model, delivering superior accuracy.
The purpose of undertaking the "Road Accident Severity Analysis" project is to reduce accident rates by identifying and highlighting the key causes of road accidents. By understanding these factors, the project aims to contribute to enhancing road safety and ultimately benefit humankind.
