Objective:

•	Analysing behavioural, environmental, and demographic elements that strongly influence traffic accidents.

•	Examining the degree of accidents and related variables, like kind of vehicle, speed, and state of the road.

•	Creating models to estimate the likelihood of accidents under different variables and scenarios. 

•	To contribute to a deeper understanding of road accident severity, ultimately leading to more effective strategies for reducing the incidence and impact of severe accidents.

Data Description:

The data set has been prepared from manual records of road traffic accidents for the years 2017–22. All the sensitive information has been excluded during data encoding, and finally, it has 32 features and 12316 instances of the accident.
