Objective:

•	Analysing behavioural, environmental, and demographic elements that strongly influence traffic accidents.

•	Examining the degree of accidents and related variables, like kind of vehicle, speed, and state of the road.

•	Creating models to estimate the likelihood of accidents under different variables and scenarios. 

•	To contribute to a deeper understanding of road accident severity, ultimately leading to more effective strategies for reducing the incidence and impact of severe accidents.
